# Explorator Data Analysis and K means in R
### Data visuslization of mobility patterns and machine learning applied to bikeÂ´s trips


This repository contains a code made in R focused in EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with outputs mainly focused in data visualization of mobility patters (bike trips made in the public bike system of Guadalajara Mexico). 
Along with this, there is another part of the code focused that uses  Machine Learning (method of K-means clustering which is an unsupervised method) in order to generate a clusterin of zones of the city based on their socio demogrpahic patterns. 
This was made in order to match the mobility patterns made in bikes with spatial socio demographic data.
